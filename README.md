Project Overview
Level 1 Projects:

1. Temperature Converter

Description: A program that converts temperatures between Celsius and Fahrenheit based on user input.
Skills Used: Basic input/output operations, arithmetic operations.

2. Palindrome Checker

Description: A program to check whether a given word or phrase is a palindrome, ignoring spaces and punctuation.
Skills Used: String manipulation, loops, conditional statements.

3. Student Grade Calculator

Description: A program that calculates and displays the average grade of a student after inputting multiple grades.
Skills Used: Loops, arrays, basic arithmetic operations.

4. Random Password Generator

Description: A program that generates a random password based on user specifications, including the length and the inclusion of numbers, letters, and special characters.
Skills Used: Random number generation, string manipulation, user input.

Level 2 Projects:
1. Tic-Tac-Toe Game

Description: A two-player tic-tac-toe game that allows players to compete against each other with the game checking for a win or draw condition.
Skills Used: Arrays or matrices, loops, conditional statements.

2. Password Strength Checker

Description: A program that evaluates the strength of a user-inputted password based on specific criteria.
Skills Used: String manipulation, conditional statements.

3. File Encryption/Decryption

Description: A program that allows users to encrypt or decrypt a text file using a simple encryption algorithm.
Skills Used: File handling, string manipulation, basic input/output operations.

Level 3 Projects:
